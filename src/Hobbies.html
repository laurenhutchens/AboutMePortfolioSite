        <h1>My favorite hobbies</h1>
        <p>I am a lover of writing, from journals to programming. When I'm not typing away, you'll find me with a pen in my right hand, jotting down aspirations, observations, and resolutions. <br>
            The home of my journaling lives in my beautiful bedroom where the walls that hold my movie/show posters I adore. <br>
            Ive found that watching shows and movies have taught me lessons that ive enwrapped my personality from. The Vampire Diaries, Gilmore Girls, Twilight, Pretty Little Liars, Harry Potter, are all<br>
            not only all over my walls but also my personality.</p>

                <h4>Why These Shows?</h4>
                <p>Each show I love has taught me something:
                    <em>Vampire Diaries</em> taught loyalty,
                    <em>Gilmore Girls</em> taught independence,
                    <em>Harry Potter</em> sparked my imagination.</p>
